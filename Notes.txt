GIT - Distributed version control system.

Generally version controls are 3 types:
---------------------------------------
1.Local Version Control - Local copy
2.Centralized Version Control System(CVCS) - central (Remote server)
3.DVCS - It will have entire history.


History of GIT
--------------
Open source project - Anyone can contribute , add new features
Normal project (company)| proprietary project - set of limited people


Advantages of GIT:
------------------
* Simple to use
* Fast
* Branching
* Fully distributed

Branch:
------
By default its branch is "master"


After GIT installation
----------------------
we need to have our own identify whenever we are working with team

>git config: it gives details like username, email
>git config --global --list -> it gives global values(mail and username)

To set a values:
----------------
>git config --global user.name = 'venky'
>git config --global user.email = 'mailId' 
>git commit config --globl


Steps:
------
> We need to create a local repository for that we have to init

*git init
it will initialize empty repo and create .git hidden file , this .git help us track staging area, commit history
note: files didn't relation with .git only, files only for project.
-->Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/venka/OneDrive/Desktop/Git/.git/

> To check status of our working directory
 
*git status
--> On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

>so, whenever we initialize by default it will give master.
if we need main
*git init -b main
*git status
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

*git add <file name>
>This will add file into staging area
but not commited yet!.

> git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)       
        new file:   Notes.txt

*git log 
>This will helps us to know commit history 

fatal: your current branch 'main' does not have any commits yet

*git commit -m "My first commit"
> -m - message
[main (root-commit) 8459337] My first commit
 1 file changed, 78 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 Notes.txt

8459337 - everytime a change happen git create a checksum 

notes: must add to statging area before commit by git add 

//Git skips the statging area 

*git commit -a -m "My third commit"

>we can skip the statging and we can do direct commit 

*git diff
>it will show changes in the file i.e. no of lines we added or changed

*git diff --staged
>this will use in stagging area 
> it will show changes in staged area

*git add . --> add all files
Readme.md --> md - mark down
